Blaze is a multi-system "emulator". PLEASE READ THIS.

## Setup
Blazelib (the core of Blaze) is a library for translating functions from other systems to Python functions. It is currently work in progress.
In order for Blazelib to work, it needs a definition file, however, ~~there currently are none at the time of writing~~ the current definition files are very beta, the NES one only has BRK instructions implemented. Additionally, instructions with arguments will not work at all. The definition file provides information about the CPU that it is emulating.

**Note: Sharing Blazelib Definition files is allowed and is not piracy**

In order to use Blaze, you need a definition file
